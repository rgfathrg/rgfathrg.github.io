        <p>Educated in criminology at West Virginia University I took my newly acquired
        skills to China to teach children how to speak the wonder language of English. From there 
        began a job carousel through gym membership sales, adminstrator at a self-defense gym, bank teller, and financial operations. My cure for the daily douldrums is travel, eating out, reading a riveting story,  
        taking in the fresh air of good ole nature, and of course having adventures with my family. 
        </p>
        <p>I have been fortunate to have called several places home including Maryland, China, Washington D.C.,
        and North Carolina. Each place has brought awesome experiences and a generous quantity of amazing people. Currently 
        I reside in Charlotte, North Carolina while continuing to work in financial operations. Passionate about the powerful 
        tool money can be in supporting one's goals I have aspirations of building applications and games that encourage financial
        literacy and build financial independence. 
        </p>
        <p>As a space enthusiasit I am eagerly awaiting the day when we touch back down on the moon and finally reach Mars. 
        The impossible seems so small among the great expanse. Perhaps, one day I can touch the outer limits but for now I'll just
        keep looking up.
